2. About the 13-Month Calendar
The Full Redux Calendar is inspired by the 13-month calendar concept, which has been explored and proposed throughout history as a way to create a more logical and balanced year.

Historical Context:

The Gregorian Calendar, which is widely used today, divides the year into 12 irregular months, causing inconsistencies in the calendar system.
Many proposals for a 13-month calendar emerged to address these irregularities, notably in the early 20th century. The International Fixed Calendar, for example, divided the year into 13 equal months of 28 days, ensuring consistent months and weekdays.
3. The Justification for the Full Redux Calendar
The Full Redux Calendar brings this concept into the modern era, aiming for a calendar that is:

Balanced: Each month consists of 28 days, totaling 364 days in a year.
Logical: A consistent structure eliminates the irregularities of 30- and 31-day months.
Adaptable: It accommodates leap years (Double Zero Days) and provides clarity.
By starting the year on the Winter Solstice instead of January 1st or April 1st, the Full Redux Calendar aligns with natural cycles rather than arbitrary dates:

The Winter Solstice marks the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. It symbolizes the rebirth of light, a natural starting point for a new cycle.
January 1st was an arbitrary decision imposed during the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar.
April 1st has roots in older calendars but doesn't align as strongly with natural phenomena.
Key Benefits of Starting on the Winter Solstice:

It aligns human timekeeping with astronomical events, grounding our calendar in nature.
It provides a symbolic and seasonal starting point for a new year.
